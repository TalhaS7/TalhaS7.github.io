                    <p>
                    UI/UX design plays an important role in customer satisfaction. in my degree i have learnt so many techniques on UI/UX design
                    which include InVision Studio, Axure, Craft and framerX. in these u can really create a look and view of the whole website you are 
                    going to design for customer,
                    also i have work on responsiveness of the website which makes these websites work on any kind of screen ie its a phone or tabet or a desktop
                    
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="item-title">Animations</h4>
                    <p>
                    Animations in websites always gives a good impressions to viewers, as it makes the website fully alive, even though a website
                    is static, but these fluid animations totally changes its look and feel. i know so many animations to be used in a website, 
                    i have a good grip on bootstrap which provide us sliders and water droplet type of features.
